# Ruby Array function like each, map, collect, select uses blocks

puts "After transform! : #{array.inspect}"

=begin
- Call transform! to the Array of numbers.
- When yield is called with the number n (first time is 1, second time is 2, etcâ€¦),
  pass the number to the block of code given.
- The block has the number available (also called n) and squares it.
  As it is the last value handled by the block, it is returned automatically.
- Yield outputs the value returned by the block, and rewrites the value in the array.
- This continues for each element in the array.
